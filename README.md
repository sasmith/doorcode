# DoorCode

DoorCode provides an endpoint for building callboxes, and performs basic authentication. Basically, you call it from your callbox, it asks you for a password, and if you get it right, it buzzes you in.

## Installation

To run DoorCode yourself, you'll need a [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), and [Asana](https://www.asana.com/) account.

Further installation instructions to follow, as I add better scripting.
